### User Story:

As a travel enthusiast,
I want to post my travel stories and experiences on the blog, and read others' travel blogs,
So that I can share and learn about different travel experiences, destinations, and tips.

### Acceptance Criteria:

Given I am on the Travel Blog app's homepage, 
When I want to see the latest travel stories, 
Then I should find a list of new posts with pictures and short descriptions.

Given I want to share my travel experience, 
When I choose to write a new blog post, 
Then I should be able to write my story, upload photos, and share it.

Given I've written my post and added photos, 
When I click the submit button, 
Then my story should be posted for others to see and I should get a message saying it's live.

Given I am exploring different travel posts, 
When I click on a post, 
Then I should see the full story, all photos, and comments from others.

Given I am not logged in, 
When I try to post a story or comment, 
Then I should be asked to log in or sign up first.

Given I want to find posts about a certain place, 
When I search using relevant keywords, 
Then I should see a list of related travel blog posts.

Given I want to keep some blogs to read later, 
When I hit a 'save' or 'bookmark' button on a post, 
Then that post should be saved to a special list in my profile.

Given I use the app often and want quick access, 
When I decide to install the app, 
Then I should have the option to install it as a Progressive Web Application (PWA).
